         <p> I was originally born in Iran, but I live in the United Kingdom. I guess I love both countries equally, but I prefer to live in the UK! In this website I am going to talk to you about some of my hobbies</p>

         <h1> Programming </h1>

         <p> Programming is one of my hobbies. Currently, I am learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I also hope to learn Python later. I  hope to get a job out of it, but I wonder <em> what if I get a job and then I get bored of it...</em> What do you think?</p>

         <h1> Chess </h1> 
         <img src="https://www.chess-international.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Shohreh-Bayat.jpg" alt="Shohreh is playing chess for England national team" class="img">
         <p> I have been playing chess since I was 9 years old, and I have won many chess events in Iran, and a few abroad. I love playing fast online chess (blitz), and my favourite website is <a href= "https://www.chess.com/home">Chess.com</a>. If you are looking for a free website to play chess and learn then I can recommend <a href="https://lichess.org/">lichess</a>.</p>

         <h1> Gardening</h1>
         <p> I have a Master's Degree in Natural Resources Engineering, Forestry. Yet, sometimes I feel I know nothing about the environment,  while other days I feel I am an expert! <br> The truth is that I really love trees and plants, and I enjoy being in forest, therefore, I decided to start a voluntary role with Bromley Green Gym where my main project is taking care of a Jasmine flower.</p>

         <h1 id="community"> My Community </h1>

         <p> If you raised you eyebrows to say a community is not a hobby, I agree with you, but I am biased and wanted to include CYF anyway! <br> Besides, in my community <span class="red-highlight"> <strong> "Code Your Future"</strong></span>, we have fun, and we learn how to grow together. I am very lucky to be part of this warm and safe community. My journey with CYF continues, and I will update you more about it later</p>

         <h1> Reading</h1>
         <p> I like reading storybooks, but it is a new hobby for me. Every night before I sleep, I read a couple of pages. The only English book that I have finished is called "The Letter", but since I am getting better at reading in English, every night before sleep, I read a couple of pages from a book called "Educated".</p>

         <h1 id="contact"> Contact</h1> 
         <p> You can send me messages via <a href= "https://www.linkedin.com/in/shohreh-bayat"/>LinkedIn<a>, and I will read your messages. However, if I do not <em>know</em> you, I won't accept the connect request, because I care about having a meaningful connections with people.</p>
