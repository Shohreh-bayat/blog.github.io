        <h2 id="First-Post">My journey to the programming!</h2>

        <p> I started to like programming many years ago when my university professor passionately spoke about it, taught me how to write algorithms in my notebook, and told me that programming gives us the power to make our ideas a reality. Unfortunetly soon enough after that he left Iran!<br>
        When I moved to the UK a couple of years ago, I met the advertisement of free Coding classes for Refugees. I did not know how serious it is, and I only realised that when I missed the deadline to finish the self-study course to be accepted for the main course.<br>
        Then  I have waited eagerly for around two years for the <strong>Code Your Future</strong> course to be started again.<br> And it was finally open, but guess when? In the September 2024,  when I was already in another course! (Teaching Assistant Level 3).<br>
        I could not miss this change...<br> So I regestered and even when I had to shorty travel to the world chess Olympiad in Budapest, I managed to complete my Intro to Digital course and get approval to participate in the Intro to programming.<br>

        <h2 id="second-Post">The challenges</h2>
        <h6>18.08.2025</h6>

        
        <p>I had no clue how much the next step is compact and challenging, there was no chance that I could work, study Teaching Assistant Level 3, travel to other countries for tournaments, and yet survive in the ITP course! Therefore, I quit<Br>
        At the time, I thought the problem was being in two courses at the same time. So <strong>I gave another try</strong> later, and I reduced my tournaments, but when I travelled to Isle of Wight for work and had no time to study, I falled badly behind the spirnts that I thought I have to quit again... With hindsight, I should not have quit for being fall behind the sprint, I just had to continue and learn as much as possible.<br>

        <h2 id="third-post">The Success?</h2>
        <h6>18.08.2025</h6>
        
        <p>I cannot say that my previous attemps were a failture since <strong>each time I got better and better</strong> and I learnt alot.For me, Code Your Future is not just a programming class, I am learning life skills there, and find a place that I feel belonging.<br>
        This September 2025, I am going to participate in ITP again, and I am a different version of myself. I am more disciplined and prepared. Besides, I have no intention to travel and I want to commit to my 20 hours study per week. I hope that I manage to learn deeply, and <strong><em>I am positive that the success will come, but yet the course is very challenging and there is no gurantee</em></strong>.
